### The App's User Stories

As a user...

1. I can see a landing page with a description of what the app does and I can clearly see how to interact with the app.
2. I can type a movie title into the search box and submit the search. I will immediately be notified if the text field was empty.
3. I can see an error screen if there is a problem with getting the data, or if there were no results. These will be two separate error screens.
4. If the search was valid, and returned results, I will see a page with eight suggested movies the app has determined I may enjoy.
5. I can scroll through and read information about all eight movies, including their plot, release year, and review rating.
6. If there is not detailed information available about the movie, I can still see a simplified version of the suggestion using data from the first source.
7. I can click the title of the movie to see the movie's poster.
8. I can click a link to see the IMDB page for the movie.
9. I can start a new search by typing into the search box and resubmitting a new movie.
10. I can start a new search by clicking the button on the bottom of the suggestions.
